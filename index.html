        <h3 class="">Patterns and pedagogy</h3>
        <h4 class="activity">Activity 3 <i class="em em-left_speech_bubble"></i> </h4>
        <p class="instruction">Work in pairs or small groups. Decide which language features you would focus on for the following groups of students.</p>
  <p><u>Scenarios</u></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Graduate students who have to have a research article (written in English) published in a scientific journal in order to graduate.</li>
        <li>Undergraduate students who need to describe a process in English in their laboratory report.</li>
        <li>Undergraduate English majors who overuse linking expressions in their narrative writing.</li>
        <li>High school students who need to understand complex grammar (e.g. conditionals) to pass the Center Shiken.</li>
        <li>Junior school students struggling with present perfect continous and present perfect simple.</li>
        <li>Elementary school students who have to describe common household items.</li>
      </ol>
</div>
<div>
        <h3 class="">Your tool</h3>
        <h4 class="activity">Activity 4 <i class="em em-thinking_face"></i> </h4>
        <p class="instruction">Decide which language features you want to focus on for your students. Identify which patterns you need to identify. Identify any potential problems.</p>
  <p><u>Example</u></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Aim: help students pronounce &quot;-ed&quot; endings of regular verbs</li>
        <li>Actual pattern: final sound of base form of verb</li>
        <li>Findable Pattern: letters that realize the final sound, e.g. /f/ = f sound, but /gh/ = f sound (as in laugh)</li>
        <li>Potential problem: homographs, e.g. learned /d/ and learned /id/</li>
      </ol>

            <li><a href="https://john6938.github.io/move-visualizer-master/">Move visualizer</a></li>
         </ul>
  <p class="instruction">Work in pairs. Explain how each tool works.</p>
  </div>
<div>
<h3 class="">Regular expressions</h3>
  <h4 class="activity">Activity 7 <i class="em em-desktop_computer"></i></h4>
   <p>Regular expressions can look daunting. However, most times simple regular expressions will suffice. There are many types of regular expressions and in each computer language, they work slightly differently. In this workshop, we focus on regular expressions used in JavaScript. This presentation aims to introduce you to the key details of regular expressions. The aim is for you to remember all the details, but to have a general overall. Mr Google is probably going to assit you in finding code that someone else has already written. Rather than great programming skills, you should initially focus on developing great search skills.</p>
